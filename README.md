Portfolio of key projects

# First Project - SHODOR SIMULATION
[This](https://boincy.glitch.me) is a simulation that shows the basics of kinetic molecular theory. By using some basic math and physics accurate collision representations, this gives a basic understanding for the underlying principles of the foundations of chemistry. More information on the webpage.

# Second Project - FRC PROGRAMMING
[This](https://github.com/Team-4795/) is the team's repository for robotics code. Contributions include Motion Profiling, CV, and Autonomous robot code. More information on each of the repos.

# Third Project - PERSONAL DISCORD BOT
[This](https://github.com/fategg555/queue-bot-games) is a bot that shows a personal project that I developed over the course of several weeks. Goal was to create an accessible platform for friends to play games in an easy and GUI-friendly manner. More information about the bot in the video [here](https://youtu.be/1musmRV_NRA).
